## React Rangers Newsletter Junior #1

*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). See
[the official guide](GUIDE.md) to learn more about this tool.*

Welcome to another one in the series of React tasks that we send periodically to the subscribers
of [our official newsletter](http://eepurl.com/dyF8I9)! If you'd also like to challenge your React
programming skills and get professional code review, we'll be very happy to see you
[sign up](http://eepurl.com/dyF8I9)!

### Running

[npm start](GUIDE.md#npm-start)

### The task

Your task is to implement the `CarsDataTable` component in [src/CarsDataTable.js](src/CarsDataTable.js). This component
receives the list of cars in props as `cars` (populated from [src/carsData.json](src/carsData.json)). Each item of
the list should be rendered as a separate row and each cell should be formatted accordingly to
the data it stores. Remember to keep your components small and avoid code duplication.

Submission deadline for code review: July 4th, 2018.
